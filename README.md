# Introduction
Employed as a Data Analyst since February 2019 in the government,
I have decided to continue my education in order to develop my skills
in open-source tools and languages such as SQL, R and Tableau. 

After completing the [Google Analytics Certificate](https://github.com/Faskill)
NEEDS UPDATE, this case study puts me in the shoes of a Junior Data Analyst
in charge of providing insights to a Bike Sharing Company about the difference
between 2 types of users : Annual members and casual riders.

This case study will follow the 6-step data analysis process defined in the 
Google Data Analytics Course :

-   [Ask](#ask)
-   [Prepare](#prepare)
-   [Process](#process)
-   [Analyze](#analyze)
-   [Share](#share)

Without further ado, letâ€™s get started!
